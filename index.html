          The Space Race was an informal competition between the United States
          and the Soviet Union to see who could make the furthest advancements
          into space first. It involved the efforts to explore outer space with
          artificial satellites, to send man into space, and to land him on the
          Moon.

              Explorer 1 (international designation 1958 Alpha 1) was the first

              at 03:48 UTC from LC-26 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as
              part of the United States program for the International
              Geophysical Year and in response to the launch of the Soviet
              satellite Sputnik 1. It was the first spacecraft to recognize the
              Van Allen radiation belt, although Sputnik 2 detected it earlier.

              Lunokhod 1 (Луноход, moon walker in Russian) was the first of two
              unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as
              part of its Lunokhod program. The spacecraft which carried
              Lunokhod 1 was named Luna 17. Lunokhod was the first roving

              Luna 17 was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After

              launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the

              maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered lunar orbit on

              more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
              new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was

                While the Sputnik 1 launch can clearly be called the start of the
                Space Race, its end is more debatable. Most hotly contested during
                the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo
                moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five
                more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
                new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
                intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.

                  Explorer 1 (international designation 1958 Alpha 1) was the first
                  Earth satellite of the United States, launched on February 1, 1958
                  at 03:48 UTC from LC-26 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as
                  part of the United States program for the International
                  Geophysical Year and in response to the launch of the Soviet
                  satellite Sputnik 1. It was the first spacecraft to recognize the
                  Van Allen radiation belt, although Sputnik 2 detected it earlier.

                    On July 29, 1957, in recognition of the 1957-1958 International
                    Geophysical Year, the White House announced that the U.S. intended
                    to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as
                    Project Vanguard. On July 31, the Soviets announced that they
                    intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.
